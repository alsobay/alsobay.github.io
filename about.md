# I'm following my interests. 

In 2011, I was interested in bioengineering. 

In 2013, I decided biological systems took too long to deal with, and shifted to chemical engineering. 

In 2015, I decided that oil & gas didn't have enough human interaction to keep me interested. 

In 2016, I decided that management consulting didn't have enough technical work to interest me, either. 

So now I build cool things with cool people using cool data at Mozn. Until it stops being interesting, that is.
